# Final-Project-Group-2


Topic: Speech Command Recognition

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle which has audio files (.wav) of 
duration of one second. The dataset has approximately 30K audio files classified based on 14 
major labels. The dataset will be separated into train-test sets manually and processed to be 
trained on the deep learning models. The project will use deep learning models like 2D 
CNN+LSTM, CNN to find the best suitable algorithm for keyword spotting. The performance 
of the model will be evaluated based on the accuracy of prediction of keywords.
